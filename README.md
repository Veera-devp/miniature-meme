# Ayuh Savasta

The project I created has anything to do with health and life insurance.

I selected the project's problem statement, "Health and Life Insurance," which primarily addresses the health problems low-poverty people face. We distinguish ourselves from other insurance management firms by focusing mostly on sick people and offering full-time life insurance.

I called the undertaking "Ayuh Svasta" in Sanskrit, which translates as "life and health" in English. The insurance gateway for all of the low-poverty people is the main subject of my idea. We give them the simplest alternatives when they want instant insurance. Sending all of our patients to the best medical institutions is a major priority. Our guiding principle is that "No person should be sick," thus we provide free monthly checkups to all of our members. Customers who have trouble using this website can also get in touch with customer care and speak with an agent.

Even today, receiving quality medical care in a private hospital seems like a far-off fantasy for people of poor and moderate income. Less than a quarter of India's overall population, as may be inferred from data, has a sizable health insurance plan. And of those with health insurance, around 70% are protected by several government programmes.
